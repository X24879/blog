	<p>This is a blog, but not like any other blog. This is a blog that has been hand-typed with HTML and CSS. Unfortunately,
		nothing technological likes me, so it will be... <em>interesting</em> to see what the end result is. So, let's begin this madness.</p>

  <p id="1">So. The big one. The first blog-post thing. Just a platform for me, a rando (unless you know me from real life, but I doubt that), to type and for you, the reader, to... well, read it. Not much else that you can do. I wonder what brought you here. Just to read on and on as I waffle. Anyway, this blog will be about general things that I want to talk about, like a readable podcast. Or a stand-up comedy routine, depending on your sense of humor. Almost nothing will be learnt from this site. So my advice to you is so stop reading. If you are still here, you might want to still stop reading. Because this blog post is over. Wait, how long will it take for me to finish making this blog site? Oh well, it'll help improve my CSS and HTML skills, so that's good. But I should go now.</p>

  <p id="2"> I'm starting this blog with some notices. I have my first upvote! Thanks a lot for supporting this struggle. Secondly, if you view this at different times, The blog gets longer. If you haven't sussed it out yet, I've written a chunk of the post but not the full thing. I'm also changing the fonts as I don't like them. *changes fonts* That's much better! I'm enjoying this... But anyway, when this blog gets longer, I'm going to introduce a link to jump to the nearest article. I don't think that this blog is going to be <em>big</em>, but I don't care. As long as I'm having fun doing this,I'm continuing it. Maybe I'll get a custom domain and make it a proper website... But that's some thoughts for later.</p>
  <p>So, to the <em>actual</em> waffling.</p>
